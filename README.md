# Overview and requirements

**The app:**
- Reads data from a JSON file.
- Displays the data in a list view screen.
- Allows navigation from each list item (event) to an editable detailed view screen.
- Allows data editing in the detailed view screen and reactively update the dataset and the UI 
- Contains both `Views(xml)` and `Jetpack Compose` implementation of the UI sharing as much business logic as possible

**The data consists of:**
- An array of `Event` instances.
- Each `Event` contains an array of `Result` instances.
- The relationship between `Event` and `Result` is 1-N

**`Event` Properties:**
- id - unique identifier for the event.
- desc - string describing the event.
- sync - boolean indicating if the event is synchronized with the backend (default is true).
- updated? - optional timestamp for the last update made to the event or its results (default is null = "never").
- validity? - optional integer representing how many seconds until the event decays:
    - 0 means the event has already decayed.
    - null means the event doesn't decay.

**`Result` Properties:**
- id - unique identifier for the result.
- desc - string describing the result.
- type - enum with values "AUTO" and "MANUAL" (case-insensitive).
- value? - optional integer representing the value of the result.

**App Functionality:**
- Upon first launch, the app should:
  - Read and deserialize the JSON data.
  - Display a list view of events.
- Non-decayed events should:
  - Be tappable, leading to a detail view screen.
  - Display only the "MANUAL" results (ignore "AUTO" results).
- In the detail view, users should:
  - Add new "MANUAL" results.
  - Modify the value of any existing result.

**UI Design Requirements:**
- Font color:
  - Black for non-decayed events.
  - Green for updated events.
  - Red for decayed events.
- Events should decay automatically:
  - Based on their validity value.
  - UI dynamically updates to red once an event decays (e.g., if validity = 10, the event turns red after 10 seconds).
- When a `Result` is added or updated:
  - The eventâ€™s validity resets to its initial value from the JSON.
  - The sync and updated properties should be updated.
  - The event should display in green until it decays again, then turn red.

# Solution

The solution is built using `Clean Architecture` principles combined with the `MVVM` design pattern. 

The project consists of 3 modules:
- `app_compose` - `Jetpack Compose` implementation of UI layer  
- `app_views` - `Views` implementation of UI layer  
- `core` - ViewModels and the remaining layers: domain + data (the data is exposed to the UI layer through the ViewModels flows)

also used: `Hilt`, `Flows`, `Coroutines`, `Gson`, `ViewModel`

# TODO:

1. Add tests (UI, snapshot, unit)
2. Decay timer refactor
3. Add Room db
4. Refactor connections between the layers (models types)
5. Add reload functionality
